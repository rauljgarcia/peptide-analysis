sequence_tools.py

This module provides tools for working with peptide fragments, including
validation of cleavage consistency and sequence reconstruction from ordered fragments.
Designed to complement the enzyme cleavage functions in enzymes.py.

def validate_ordered_fragments(fragments: list[str]) -> bool:

    Validates whether a list of peptide fragments is in correct order
    and can be reconstructed into a valid sequence.

    Parameters:
    fragments : list[str], List of peptide fragments (strings) in order.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the fragments are valid for reconstruction, False otherwise.
